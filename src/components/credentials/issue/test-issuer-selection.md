# Issuer DID Selection - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. State Management Updates
- **Added `issuerOptions`** to wizard state containing:
  - `selectedDID?: string` - The selected DID from available DIDs
  - `customDID?: string` - Custom DID entered by user  
  - `useCustomDID: boolean` - Toggle between existing vs custom DID

### 2. DID Fetching
- **Automatic DID Loading**: Fetches all active DIDs when wizard loads
- **Loading State**: Shows loading spinner while fetching DIDs
- **Error Handling**: Displays toast notification if DID fetching fails
- **No Default Selection**: Removed automatic selection of first DID (as per requirements)

### 3. Issuer Selection UI
- **Radio Button Options**: 
  - "Use existing DID" - Select from dropdown of available DIDs
  - "Use custom DID" - Enter any DID manually
- **Dynamic Dropdown**: Populates with user's active DIDs, showing DID + method + creation date
- **Custom Input Field**: Allows manual DID entry with placeholder and help text
- **Validation**: Shows error message if no issuer DID is selected

### 4. Validation Updates
- **Step 1 Validation**: Added issuer DID validation to data entry step
- **Step 2 Validation**: Maintained existing validation for review step  
- **Step Completion**: Updated logic to require issuer DID selection for step completion
- **Error Display**: Shows validation errors inline with form fields

### 5. Credential Issuance Integration
- **Helper Function**: `getCurrentIssuerDID()` returns the selected DID based on user choice
- **Issue Logic**: Uses selected/custom DID when issuing credentials
- **Review Display**: Shows selected issuer DID in credential preview

## üîß Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. **SimpleCredentialWizard.tsx**
   - Added state management for issuer options
   - Added DID fetching logic
   - Updated validation and step completion logic
   - Added issuer change handlers

2. **DataEntryStep.tsx** 
   - Added issuer selection UI section
   - Implemented radio buttons and conditional display
   - Added dropdown for existing DIDs and input for custom DID

3. **ReviewStep.tsx** (interface updated previously)
   - Updated to accept issuer DID prop
   - Displays selected issuer in credential preview

### Key Functions
- `getCurrentIssuerDID()`: Returns current issuer DID based on selection
- `handleIssuerChange()`: Updates issuer options state
- DID validation in `validateStep()` for both steps 1 and 2

## üéØ Requirements Met

- ‚úÖ **Select Option for Issuer DID**: Added dropdown with available DIDs
- ‚úÖ **Custom DID Input**: Added option to enter any DID manually  
- ‚úÖ **No Default Selection**: Removed automatic selection of first DID
- ‚úÖ **Explicit Selection Required**: Added validation requiring selection
- ‚úÖ **Integration with Wizard**: Fully integrated with existing wizard flow

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. User sees "No DID selected" initially
2. User can choose from dropdown of available DIDs
3. User can switch to custom DID and enter manually
4. Validation prevents proceeding without selection
5. Selected DID is used for credential issuance

### Edge Cases
- No active DIDs available - shows message and allows custom input
- Invalid custom DID - shows validation error
- Network error fetching DIDs - shows error toast, allows custom input
- Switching between existing/custom resets previous selection

## üîÑ Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **DID Validation**: Add client-side DID format validation
2. **DID Details**: Show more DID metadata in dropdown (status, description, etc.)
3. **DID Creation**: Add quick link to create new DID if none available
4. **Recent DIDs**: Remember and suggest recently used DIDs
5. **DID Search**: Add search/filter for large DID lists

## üìù Usage

The issuer DID selection is now fully integrated into the credential issuance wizard:

1. Navigate to the credential issuance wizard
2. Complete template selection (Step 1)  
3. In data entry (Step 2), scroll to "Issuer DID" section
4. Choose between existing DID (dropdown) or custom DID (input)
5. Complete other required fields
6. Proceed to review - selected DID will be shown
7. Issue credential using the selected issuer DID

The implementation ensures users must explicitly select an issuer DID before proceeding, meeting all the specified requirements.
